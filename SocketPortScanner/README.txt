### How the Script Works
1. The script prompts the user to input the IP address of the host (either an IP address or hostname).
2. The user is then asked to input a port number they want to check.
3. The `portScanner()` function is called, where it attempts to connect to the specified port on the given host using `socket.connect_ex()`. 
4. If the connection is successful (i.e., the port is open), it prints "The port is open." 
5. If the connection fails (i.e., the port is closed), it prints "The port is closed."
6. The socket connection times out after 5 seconds if no connection is established.

### Notes
- The script checks only one port at a time, based on user input.
- The `settimeout(5)` method ensures that the connection attempt will time out after 5 seconds if no response is received from the host.
- The script is designed for basic port scanning and doesn't handle multiple ports or more complex scanning methods (such as SYN scanning).
