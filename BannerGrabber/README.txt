This Python script is a simple Banner Grabber tool that connects to a specified IP address and port, attempts to grab the banner (if available), and prints it to the console. Banners are typically used by services running on open ports to identify themselves and their versions.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- The `socket` module (built-in Python library)

### How to Run
1. Save the script as `banner_grabber.py`.
2. Open a terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the script using Python:

### Script Workflow
1. The script prompts the user for an IP address and port number.
2. It then calls the `BannerGrabber` function with the provided IP and port.
3. The `BannerGrabber` function attempts to connect to the provided IP address and port using a socket connection.
4. Once connected, the script waits for a banner to be sent by the service on the specified port.
5. The banner (if received) is printed to the console. If no banner is received, the script will time out after 5 seconds.

### Example Output

### Notes
- Banners are typically found on common services such as HTTP (port 80), FTP (port 21), and SMTP (port 25).
- Some services might not send banners, or may require specific data to be sent first (like a GET request for HTTP servers).
- The script has a 5-second timeout set for each connection attempt, which means it will wait up to 5 seconds to receive a response.

### Troubleshooting
- Ensure the IP address and port are correct.
- The service on the port might not send a banner, or it might be filtered by a firewall.
- If you encounter timeouts, try using a different port or increasing the timeout duration.

### Customization
- You can modify the script to support multiple ports or different scanning techniques (e.g., sending a specific HTTP request to retrieve a more accurate banner).
- The script currently grabs a maximum of 1024 bytes of data. You can modify this number if you need to grab larger banners.
